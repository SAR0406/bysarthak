/**
 * This ruleset implements a secure "dropbox" model for a public contact form,
 * secures user profile data, and manages conversation groups for an admin panel.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * - Admin Access: A single, hardcoded admin email has full read/write privileges
 *   across the database for administrative tasks. This is the most secure and
 *   direct way to grant admin rights without relying on other database reads.
 * - Conversations: Implements a "write-only" dropbox for guests. Anyone can
 *   create or add messages to a conversation document. Reading is restricted.
 *   - The Admin can list and read all conversations.
 *   - A signed-in user can only read their own conversation, identified by their email.
 * - User Profiles: Users can create and update their own profiles. Reading is public.
 * - Groups: All group management is restricted to the admin.
