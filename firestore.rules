/**
 * This ruleset implements a secure "dropbox" model for a public contact form,
 * secures user profile data, and manages conversation groups.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * - Conversations: Anyone can create a conversation or add messages to it.
 *   Only the designated admin can read all conversations. A user can read
 *   their own conversation history.
 * - User Profiles: Users can read their own profile and other public profiles,
 *   but can only create and update their own.
 * - Groups: Only admins can create, read, update, and delete groups.
 * - Admin Roles: Admin status is checked by a direct email comparison in a helper function.
